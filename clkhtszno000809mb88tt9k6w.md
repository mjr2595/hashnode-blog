Sorry for the horribly pixelated pic... (edit: uploaded better pic)

This was pretty cool. I have been familiar with \[DonTheDeveloper\]([https://www.youtube.com/@DonTheDeveloper/featured](https://www.youtube.com/@DonTheDeveloper/featured)) for a bit. I actually watched a couple of his videos about Nucamp before making my decision to attend. So it was a little surreal to get hit up in DM on LinkedIn by Don asking if I'd like to be on the podcast. I legit thought it was spam.

But yeah, I had a good time! Hopefully, this video can help someone with their bootcamp selection.

Oh yeah here's the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQksD9a-9bw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQksD9a-9bw)
