Ok so [it's been a while](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nGRNEaulQs) since I've posted anything...

To keep it short, after my bootcamp I accepted a volunteer position at a non-profit organization as a Flutter developer. I've never used Flutter or Dart so that's been keeping me pretty busy lately. Honestly, Flutter is pretty sweet! I like Dart and the [dev tooling](https://dev.to/yassine_dev/the-ultimate-collection-of-vscode-extensions-for-flutter-56a8) around Flutter makes working with it super seamless.

If I'm being real, a part of me is wondering if learning Flutter and Dart will hurt with job hunting. I put that on the back burner for sure, but also Flutter is just more of a niche framework ([well ok maybe not](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends?tags=flutter%2Creact-native%2Cswift%2Ckotlin) lol). I think if anything it's been giving me some prospective and learning a new language is never really a *bad* thing.

Ok, so about the project. Like I said, it's a Flutter project. We're using [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) for the backend and heavily using [BLoC architecture](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/). Bloc is sort of mind bending at first, but I think I'm beginning to wrap my head around it -- shout out to [Flutterly](https://www.youtube.com/@Flutterly) on Youtube.

The app is called "Nuron" and it's a self-empowerment productivity app. Right now, the early access version is available on all major platforms: App Store, Play Store, MacOS, Windows. Right now, it's a paid app (but hmu if you want a code ðŸ˜‰). We will be implementing a more freemium type model down the road for general release.
